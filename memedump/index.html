    <p>Some top-tier memes I've accumulated over the past year or so.</p>

    <p>Most were acquired from various subreddits, and I did my best to credit them by adding the uploader's username to the image filename. (note: not necessarily the creator's username)</p>

    <p>I did my best. Many are not credited.</p>
